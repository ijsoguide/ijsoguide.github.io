    {
        question: "What is the key difference between infiltration and percolation?",
        options: [
            "Infiltration is water flowing over the land, while percolation is water soaking into the soil.",
            "Infiltration is the downward movement of water from the surface into the soil, while percolation is the further downward movement of that water through soil and rock layers.",
            "Infiltration occurs only in rivers, while percolation occurs in lakes.",
            "Infiltration is the formation of clouds, while percolation is the formation of groundwater."
        ],
        correct: "B",
        hint: "Both involve downward water movement, but one describes entry into the soil, and the other describes deeper movement.",
        detailed: "Infiltration is the initial process of water seeping from the ground surface into the upper layers of the soil. Percolation is the subsequent movement of this infiltrated water deeper down through the soil profile and underlying rock layers, often contributing to groundwater."

        question: "How does deforestation primarily impact the water cycle?",
        options: [
            "It increases transpiration and infiltration, leading to less runoff.",
            "It reduces transpiration and infiltration, leading to increased surface runoff and potential erosion.",
            "It causes an increase in groundwater recharge due to less water uptake by trees.",
            "It has no significant impact on the water cycle, only on the carbon cycle."
        ],
        correct: "B",
        hint: "Trees play a significant role in returning water to the atmosphere and helping water enter the soil.",
        detailed: "Deforestation removes trees that would otherwise contribute to transpiration (releasing water vapor) and whose roots help maintain soil structure for infiltration. This leads to reduced water return to the atmosphere via transpiration, less water soaking into the ground, and consequently, increased surface runoff, which can cause soil erosion and flooding."

        correct: "D",
        hint: "This is essentially 'plant sweat' and a key way water from land vegetation returns to the atmosphere.",
        detailed: "Transpiration is the process by which water is carried through plants from roots to small pores (stomata) on the underside of leaves, where it changes to vapor and is released to the atmosphere."

        ],
        correct: "B",
        hint: "This term combines two key ways water vapor enters the atmosphere from terrestrial environments.",
        detailed: "Evapotranspiration is a term that encompasses both the evaporation of water from soil, bodies of water, and other surfaces, and the transpiration of water from plants. It represents the total transfer of water from the land surface to the atmosphere."

            "Acid rain, which can harm ecosystems.",
            "Larger hailstones during thunderstorms."
        ],
        correct: "C",
        hint: "These gases react with water vapor and precipitation in the atmosphere.",
        detailed: "Sulfur dioxide (\(\ce{SO2}\)) and nitrogen dioxides (\(\ce{NO2}\)), released from burning fossil fuels, can react with water, oxygen, and other chemicals in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid and nitric acid. These acids then fall to Earth as acid rain, which is a form of precipitation that can have harmful effects on soil, water bodies, and living organisms."

            "More predictable and uniform precipitation patterns across all regions.",
            "A significant increase in the total amount of freshwater stored in glaciers and ice caps."
        ],
        correct: "A",
        hint: "Consider how rising temperatures might affect different phases and reservoirs of the water cycle.",
        detailed: "Climate change, driven by increased global temperatures, is expected to intensify the water cycle. This includes increased rates of evaporation from oceans and land, leading to more moisture in the atmosphere. Precipitation patterns are likely to become more variable and extreme (more intense rainfall in some areas, droughts in others), and the melting of glaciers and ice caps will accelerate, impacting sea levels and freshwater availability."
