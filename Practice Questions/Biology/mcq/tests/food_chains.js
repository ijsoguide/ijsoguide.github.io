        correct: "C",
        hint: "These organisms form the base of food chains and webs.",
        detailed: "Producers, also called autotrophs, are organisms capable of synthesizing their own food. This is typically done through photosynthesis (using sunlight) or, in some cases, chemosynthesis (using chemical energy)."

        hint: "These organisms break down dead organic material and return nutrients to the environment.",
        detailed: "Decomposers, such as fungi and bacteria, play a crucial role in ecosystems by breaking down dead organisms and waste products, thereby returning essential nutrients to the soil."

        question: "In most ecosystems, the primary source of energy for photosynthetic producers is:",
        options: [
            "Chemical energy from volcanic vents",
            "Heat from the Earth's core",

        ],
        correct: "D",
        hint: "Photosynthesis is a process that captures light energy.",
        detailed: "Photosynthesis, the process by which most producers make food, utilizes sunlight as the primary energy source to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose."

        question: "Approximately what percentage of energy is typically passed on from one trophic level to the next in a food chain?",
        options: [

            "100%"
        ],
        correct: "A",
        hint: "Energy transfer between trophic levels is not very efficient.",
        detailed: "Only about 10% of the energy available at one trophic level is transferred to the next. The remaining 90% is largely lost as metabolic heat, used for life processes, or is undigested."

    {
        question: "What is a key difference between a food web and a food chain?",
        options: [
            "Food chains show multiple energy pathways, while food webs show a single pathway.",
            "Food webs are simple diagrams, while food chains are complex and realistic.",
            "Food webs consist of interconnected food chains and show organisms having multiple food sources.",
            "Food chains always include decomposers, while food webs do not."
        ],
        correct: "C",
        hint: "Consider which model offers a more comprehensive view of feeding relationships in an ecosystem.",
        detailed: "A food web is a more realistic representation of an ecosystem's feeding relationships because it shows multiple interconnected food chains, illustrating that most organisms consume more than one type of food and that energy can flow in various directions."

        question: "An organism that feeds exclusively on producers (plants or algae) is best described as a:",

        correct: "C",
        hint: "This type of consumer is the first to eat the organisms that make their own food.",
        detailed: "Primary consumers, also known as herbivores, are organisms that obtain their energy by eating producers (plants or algae)."

        question: "Which statement best distinguishes detritivores from decomposers?",
        options:[
            "Detritivores create their own food, while decomposers eat dead organisms.",
            "Detritivores primarily eat dead animals, while decomposers eat dead plants.",
            "Detritivores ingest dead organic matter but don't fully break it down into nutrients, while decomposers break down dead matter and return nutrients.",
            "Detritivores are animals, while decomposers are only fungi."
        ],
        correct: "C",
        hint: "Both deal with dead organic matter, but their method and end-products differ.",
        detailed: "Detritivores (e.g., earthworms, millipedes) consume fragments of dead organic matter (detritus). Decomposers (e.g., fungi, bacteria) chemically break down dead organisms and waste into simpler substances, returning nutrients to the ecosystem. Detritivores aid decomposers by breaking down matter into smaller pieces."

        question: "Food chains typically do not exceed 4-5 trophic levels. The primary reason for this limitation is:",
        optios:[
            "Most ecosystems lack a sufficient variety of species for longer chains.",
            "There is a significant loss of available energy at each transfer between trophic levels.",
            "Producers cannot generate enough energy to support more than a few consumer levels.",
            "Organisms at higher trophic levels are too large to find enough food."
        ],
        correct: "B",
        hint: "Consider the efficiency of energy transfer mentioned in the context of food chains.",
        detailed: "Due to the inefficient transfer of energy (only about 10% passed on) from one trophic level to the next, there is not enough energy remaining to support a large number of trophic levels. Consequently, food chains are usually limited to 4 or 5 links."

        question: "An animal that eats both plants and other animals (e.g., a bear that eats berries and fish) would be classified as:",
        options: [
            "Only a primary consumer.",
            "Only a secondary consumer.",
            "An omnivore, potentially acting as both a primary and secondary (or higher) consumer.",
            "A producer."
        ],
        correct: "C",
        hint: "Some organisms don't fit neatly into just one consumer category based on their diet.",
        detailed: "Omnivores are animals that consume both plant matter (making them primary consumers when they do so) and animal matter (making them secondary or tertiary consumers). Organisms can indeed play multiple roles in a food web."
    },
    {
        question: "Some producer organisms, particularly those in deep-sea environments near volcanic vents, make their own food using:",
        options: [

        ],
        correct: "D",
        hint: "These producers thrive in environments where sunlight is absent.",
        detailed: "Chemosynthesis is a process used by certain organisms, such as bacteria near deep-sea volcanic vents, to produce food using energy derived from chemical reactions with inorganic compounds, rather than from sunlight. This allows them to be producers in environments without light."

    {
        question: "If producers in a food chain capture 10,000 units of energy, approximately how many units of energy would be available to a tertiary consumer in that chain, assuming a 10% transfer efficiency at each level?",
        options: [
            "1000 units",
            "100 units",
            "10 units",
            "1 unit"
        ],
        correct: "C",
        hint: "Apply the 10% energy transfer rule sequentially through the trophic levels: Producer → Primary Consumer → Secondary Consumer → Tertiary Consumer.",
        detailed: "Energy from Producers to Primary Consumers: 10,000 units×10%=1,000 units. Energy from Primary Consumers to Secondary Consumers: 1,000 units×10%=100 units. Energy from Secondary Consumers to Tertiary Consumers: 100 units×10%=10 units. Thus, only about 10 units of energy would be available to the tertiary consumer."

        question: "Which of the following best describes the specific feeding strategy of a scavenger?",
        options: [
            "They break down dead organic matter into simple nutrients for the soil.",
            "They consume the carcasses of animals that are already dead, which they did not hunt.",
            "They hunt and kill live animals for food.",
            "They filter small organic particles from water or soil."
        ],
        correct: "B",
        hint: "Think about how scavengers obtain their meals from animals without actively hunting them.",
        detailed: "Scavengers, such as vultures or hyenas, specialize in feeding on the dead bodies (carcasses) of animals. They differ from predators because they do not typically hunt the animals they eat; instead, they find animals that have died from other causes. Decomposers (A) break down matter fully. Detritivores might eat fragments of dead organic matter, but scavengers focus specifically on animal carcasses."
