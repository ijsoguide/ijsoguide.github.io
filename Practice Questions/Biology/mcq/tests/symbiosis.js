            "In commensalism one species benefits and the other is unaffected, while in mutualism both species benefit.",
            "In commensalism one species benefits at the expense of the other, while in mutualism one is unaffected.",
            "Commensalism is always obligate, while mutualism is always facultative."
        ],

        detailed: "Ectosymbiosis refers to a symbiotic relationship where one organism lives on the outer surface of the other (e.g., lice on a human). Endosymbiosis occurs when one organism lives within the tissues or cells of the other (e.g., Rhizobium bacteria in plant root nodules)."

            "Facultative mutualism"
        ],
        correct: "D",
        hint: "The relationship is beneficial but not strictly necessary for the individual survival of either partner.",
        detailed: "This describes facultative mutualism. Both species benefit from the interaction (+/+), but the relationship is not essential for their survival; they can live independently."
    },
    {
        question: "Lichens are composite organisms formed by a fungus and an alga (or cyanobacterium). The fungus provides structure, protection, and absorbs water/minerals, while the alga provides food through photosynthesis. Neither can typically survive alone in the environments where lichens are found. This relationship is best described as:",

        correct: "A",
        hint: "Consider both the type of benefit for each partner and whether they can live apart.",
        detailed: "This is an example of obligate mutualism. Both the fungus and the alga / cyanobacterium benefit from the association (+/+), and the relationship is essential for their survival in the harsh environments lichens often inhabit; they generally cannot survive independently under such conditions."

    {
        question: "Neutralism (0/0), where neither species affects the other, is described as difficult to prove in nature. This is likely because:",
        options: [
            "Most species are in direct competition with each other.",
            "All species inevitably harm each other to some degree.",
            "There might be subtle, indirect, or unnoticed interactions occurring between species that are not immediately obvious.",
            "Neutralism only occurs in laboratory settings, not in natural ecosystems."
        ],
        correct: "C",
        hint: "Ecosystems are complex, and interactions can be multifaceted.",
        detailed: "Proving true neutralism is challenging because ecological systems are intricate. Even if direct interactions are not apparent, species can be linked through indirect pathways (e.g., via shared resources, predators, or other community members) or have very subtle effects on each other that are difficult to detect and measure."

    {
        question: "A characteristic feature of many parasitic relationships, as noted, is that the parasite usually does not kill its host immediately. Why is this generally advantageous for the parasite?",
        options: [
            "It allows the host to develop immunity, making the parasite stronger.",
            "Killing the host too quickly would eliminate the parasite's source of food and shelter, potentially before the parasite can reproduce.",
            "It gives the host a chance to find another symbiotic partner for the parasite.",
            "It ensures the parasite can transform into a non-parasitic form."
        ],
        correct: "B",
        hint: "The parasite's survival and ability to reproduce are often linked to the host remaining alive for a certain period.",
        detailed: "For many parasites, especially those that are obligate or have complex life cycles, the host's survival is crucial for the parasite's own survival, growth, and reproduction. If the host dies too quickly, the parasite may not have enough time to complete its life cycle or spread to new hosts."
