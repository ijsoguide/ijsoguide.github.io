        ],
        correct: "B",
        hint: "This process results in an overabundance of plant life that ultimately harms the aquatic environment.",
        detailed: "Eutrophication is the enrichment of water bodies with nutrients (like nitrogen and phosphorus), often from agricultural runoff or sewage.

        detailed: "Acid rain forms when sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, released mainly from the combustion of fossil fuels and industrial processes, react with water, oxygen, and other chemicals in the atmosphere. These reactions produce sulfuric acid and nitric acid, which then fall to the Earth as acidic precipitation (rain, snow, fog)."

        detailed: "Deforestation leads to a direct loss of habitat for countless species, reducing biodiversity. The removal of tree cover exposes soil to rain and wind, leading to increased soil erosion. Furthermore, forests play a vital role in absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) through photosynthesis; their removal reduces this carbon uptake capacity, thereby contributing to climate change."
