        correct: "A",
        hint: "Like many natural cycles, this one involves both creation and breakdown processes to maintain equilibrium.",
        detailed: "The natural ozone layer is maintained by a dynamic equilibrium where ozone is constantly being formed (from \(\ce{O2}\) and O) and constantly being destroyed by natural processes (such as absorption of UV radiation by \(\ce{O3}\), and reaction of \(\ce{O3}\) with O). This balance can be disrupted by human activities."
