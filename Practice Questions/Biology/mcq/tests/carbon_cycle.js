        hint: "Focus on how greenhouse gases interact with Earth's energy balance.",
        detailed: "Human activities, especially burning fossil fuels and deforestation, increase the concentration of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

        hint: "Consider processes that lock carbon away in the Earth's crust for very extended periods.",
        detailed: "The lithosphere serves as a long-term carbon reservoir. Carbon is sequestered for millions of years through the formation of sedimentary rocks like limestone (calcium carbonate), often derived from the shells and skeletons of marine organisms. Additionally, under specific conditions, dead organic matter accumulates and transforms over geological time into fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), another form of long-term carbon storage."
