            "\( F = ma \)", 
            "An object remains in motion/rest unless acted on",

        hint: "Think about inertia.",
        detailed: "Newton’s First Law (law of inertia) says that an object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion, unless acted upon by a net external force."

        hint: "Which law talks about equal and opposite?",
        detailed: "Newton’s Third Law explains that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. The recoil is the opposite reaction to the forward bullet motion."
