    <h1>Mindset Guide</h1>
  <p class="Ayeshac">    CONGRATULATIONS! 🎉👏
You’ve just discovered that you were chosen to represent your country in one of the most prestigious international science Olympiads—THE IJSO!</p>
<p class="Filipc">
Your mindset is the single most important thing for your success in this competition, but also more generally in everything you do. So we feel like we should help you get the right mindset, avoid common mind traps, and make this experience as pleasant and memorable as possible.
Oh, we forgot to introduce ourselves 😅</p>
<p class="Filipc">I’m Filip (FiliKili), your prince charming ;) , representing the confident ones</p>
<p class="Ayeshac">And I’m Ayesha, the gay one. I am totally in love with lidaaaaa (INTRODUCE YOURSELF HOW YOU WANT THIS IS A JOKE)
</p>
<p class="Ayeshac">
Together we will try to complement each other and cover all the scenarios the reader could find themselves in </p>
<p class="Ayeshac">
And we hope you find this useful and wish you all the best💖
    </p>
<h2>THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF COMPETITORS:
</h2>
<p class="Ayeshac">A) 😎 The confident competitor – You’re feeling good about your skills; you’ve prepared well, and you’re ready to take on the challenge and work even harder.</p> 
<p class="Ayeshac">B) 😓 The ‘not-so-confident’ competitor – You’re overwhelmed, doubting yourself, and wondering if you deserve this.</p>
<p class="Ayesha">It’s essential to identify which group you fall into. Take a moment to think about this carefully—it will help you decide how to approach the intense preparations and guide your studies. Identifying your group should calm you down, not add to your stress. It will also serve as a reminder to stay humble while still believing in yourself and your abilities.</p>
  <p class="Ayesha">If you’re in Group A, that’s fantastic! However, remember that even the best competitors can be caught off guard. Your confidence is admirable, but don’t let it get to your head and turn into overconfidence. Remember, there’s always room for improvement! 💪 Keep an open mind, never underestimate the competition, and continue to put in your best effort. You may not feel the need to focus on this section, but there’s no harm in reading it—you might discover something new or pick up on something that could still benefit you.</p>
  <p class="Ayesha">If you’re in Group B, breathe. You’re not alone. The truth is, almost everyone feels this way at some point. The key is to shift your focus: don’t fixate solely on the results; focus on the experience. You’ve made it this far, and that in itself is something to be proud of. This section was written especially to help you manage your stress levels and find the best way to move forward. It’s not as overwhelming once you break things down and tackle each challenge step by step. ✨👍</p>
