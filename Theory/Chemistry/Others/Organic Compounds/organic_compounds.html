    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Organic chemistry is often described as the chemistry of life. It focuses on compounds built around the element carbon, and understanding it is essential not only for mastering IJSO questions but also for building a deeper appreciation of the molecular logic behind biology, medicine, and modern materials.</p>
    <br><p>In this section, we’ll explore the foundation: what makes a compound organic, the types of basic organic compounds, and how we classify and understand them structurally and functionally. Our goal is not rote memorization, but to develop an instinctive grasp of patterns — the kind of insight that helps you work through unfamiliar molecules in competition settings with clarity and confidence.</p>

    <h2>What Are Organic Compounds?</h2>
    <p>At the most basic level, organic compounds are <b>carbon-based molecules</b>, typically containing <b>carbon (C)</b> and <b>hydrogen (H)</b>, often alongside <b>oxygen (O)</b>, <b>nitrogen (N)</b>, <b>sulfur (S)</b>, <b>phosphorus (P)</b>, and <b>halogens (F, Cl, Br, I)</b>.</p>
    <br><p>Carbon’s unique ability to form <b>four covalent bonds</b> makes it capable of creating a stunning variety of molecular shapes: <b>chains, rings, and branches</b>.</p>

    <h2>Hydrocarbons: The Backbone of Organic Chemistry</h2>
    <p>Hydrocarbons are compounds made solely of <b>carbon and hydrogen</b>, and they are classified based on the types of bonds between carbon atoms:</p>
    
    <br><h3>Alkanes (Saturated Hydrocarbons)</h3><br>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Structure:</b> Single C–C bonds</li>
        <li><b>General Formula:</b> \(\ce{C_nH_{2n+2}}\)</li>
        <li><b>Examples:</b><ul><li>Methane \(\ce{CH4}\)</li><li>Ethane \(\ce{C2H6}\)</li></ul></li>
    </ul>

    <br><h3>Alkenes (Unsaturated Hydrocarbons)</h3><br>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Structure:</b> At least one C=C double bond</li>
        <li><b>General Formula:</b> \(\ce{C_n H_{2n}}\)</li>
        <li><b>Examples:</b><ul><li>Ethene \(\ce{C2H4}\)</li><li>Propene \(\ce{C3H6}\)</li></ul></li>
    </ul>

    <br><h3>Alkynes</h3><br>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Structure:</b> At least one C≡C triple bond</li>
        <li><b>General Formula:</b> \(\ce{C_n H_{2n - 2}}\)</li>
        <li><b>Examples:</b><ul><li>Ethyne \(\ce{C2H2}\)</li><li>Propyne \(\ce{C3H4}\)</li></ul></li>
    </ul>

    <br><h3>Aromatic Hydrocarbons</h3><br>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Structure:</b> Contain benzene rings</li>
        <li><b>Examples:</b><ul><li>Benzene \(\ce{C6H5}\)</li><li>Toluene \(\ce{C6H5CH3}\)</li></ul></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Isomerism: Same Formula, Different Structure</h2>
    <p>Organic molecules with the same formula but different structures are called <b>isomers</b></p>
    <p>Understanding how atoms are arranged in space is critical in predicting chemical behavior.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Basic organic chemistry isn't about memorizing endless molecules. It’s about recognizing the familiar in the unfamiliar — seeing a hydroxyl and knowing it's an alcohol, spotting a double bond and expecting addition. For IJSO success, learn to connect structure to behavior, visualize molecular shapes, and think chemically.</p>
    <br><p>You're not just preparing for a test — you're building a way of seeing the molecular world.</p>
