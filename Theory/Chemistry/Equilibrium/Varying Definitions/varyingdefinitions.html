<h2>Arrhenius Concept of Acids and Bases</h2>
<p>We can state the Arrhenius concept of an acid as follows: </p>
<p>An acid is a substance that, when dissolved in water, increases the concentration of hydronium ion, \(\text{H}_3\text{O}^+\) (aq)</p>
<p>For simplicity, chemists frequently use the notation \(\text{H}^+\) (aq)</p>
<p>A base, in the Arrhenius concept, is a substance that, when dissolved in water, increases the concentration of hydroxide ion, \(\text{OH}^-\) (aq)</p>
<p>The special role of the hydronium ion (or hydrogen ion) and the hydroxide ion in aqueous solutions arises from the following reaction</p>
<p>\( \ce{H2O(l) + H2O(l) <=> H3O^+ (aq) + OH^- (aq)} \)</p>

<h2>Strong Acids and Bases</h2>
<p>In Arrhenius’s theory, a strong acid is a substance that completely ionizes in aqueous solution to give \(\text{H}_3\text{O}^+\)(aq) and an anion. An example is the perchloric acid \(\text{HClO}_4\)</p>
<p>\(\ce{HClO4(aq) + H2O(l) \rightarrow H3O^+(aq) + ClO4^-(aq)}\)</p>
<p>Other examples are: \(\text{HCl},\: \text{HBr}, \: \text{HNO}_3, \: \text{HI}\)</p>
<p>A strong base completely ionizes in aqueous solution to give \(\text{OH}^-\)and a cation. Sodium hydroxide is an example of a strong base</p>
<p>\(\ce{NaOH(s) + H2O \rightarrow Na^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)}\)</p>

<h2>Bronsted-Lowry concept of acids and bases</h2>
<p>According to the Brønsted–Lowry concept, an acid is the species donating a proton in a proton-transfer reaction. A base is the species accepting the proton in a proton-transfer reaction</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the reaction of hydrochloric acid with ammonia, which was mentioned in the chapter opening. Writing it as an ionic equation, you have</p>

<p>You obtain the net ionic equation:</p>
<img src="image2.png"   >
<p>In this reaction in aqueous solution, a proton, \(\text{H}^+\),  is transferred from the \(\text{H}_3\text{O}^+\) ion to the \(\text{NH}_3\) molecule, giving \(\text{H}_2\text{O}\) and \(\text{NH}_4\)</p>
<p>Here \(\text{H}_3\text{O}^+\) is the proton donor, or acid, and \(\text{NH}_3\) s the proton acceptor, or base. Note that in the Brønsted–Lowry concept, acids (and bases) can be ions as well as molecular substances.</p>
<img src="image3.png"  >
<p>A conjugate acid–base pair** consists of two species in an acid–base reaction, one acid and onebase, that differ by the loss or gain of a proton. The acid in such a pair is called the conjugate acid of the base, whereas the base is the conjugate base of the acid</p>
<h2>Amphiprotic species</h2>
<p>The Brønsted–Lowry concept defines a species as an acid or a base according to its function in the acid–base, or proton-transfer, reaction. Some species can act as either an acid or a base. An amphiprotic species is a species that can act as either an acid or a base (it can lose or gain a proton), depending on the other reactant.</p>

<h2>Lewis Concept of Acids and Bases</h2>
<p>A Lewis acid is a species that can form a covalent bond by accepting an electron pair from another species. </p>
<p>A Lewis base is a species that can form a covalent bond by donating an electron pair to another species.</p>
<p>Example: Let us look at the reaction of \(\text{Na}_2\text{O}\) with \(\text{SO}_3\). It involves the reaction of the oxide ion, \(\text{O}^{2-}\), from the ionic solid, \(\text{Na}_2\text{O}\), with \(\text{SO}_3\). </p>
<img src="image5.png"  >
<p>Here \(\text{SO}_3\) accepts the electron pair from the \(\text{O}^{2-}\) ion. At the same time, an electron pair from the \(\text{S=O}\) bond moves to the O atom. Thus, \(\text{O}^{2-}\) is the Lewis base and \(\text{SO}_3\) is the Lewis acid.</p>
