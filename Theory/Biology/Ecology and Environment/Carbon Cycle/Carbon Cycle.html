    <h2>The Carbon Cycle</h2>

    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> The continuous movement of carbon atoms between the Earth's atmosphere, oceans, land, and living organisms.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Importance:</strong> Essential for life, as carbon is the backbone of all organic molecules (carbohydrates, proteins, fats, nucleic acids). It also plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Processes & Reservoirs:</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> Carbon dioxide (CO₂) is the main form of carbon here.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Input:</strong> Respiration (breathing by animals), decomposition of organic matter, volcanic eruptions, burning of fossil fuels.</li>
          <li><strong>Output:</strong> Photosynthesis (plants take in CO₂).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Biosphere (Living Organisms):</strong> Carbon is present in the tissues of plants and animals.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Input:</strong> Plants take in CO₂ during photosynthesis to produce organic compounds. Animals obtain carbon by eating plants or other animals.</li>
          <li><strong>Output:</strong> Respiration releases CO₂. Decomposition returns carbon to the soil and atmosphere.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Oceans:</strong> A large reservoir of carbon, mainly as dissolved carbon dioxide, bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻), and carbonate (CO₃²⁻).
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Input:</strong> Absorption of CO₂ from the atmosphere.</li>
          <li><strong>Output:</strong> Release of CO₂ to the atmosphere. Carbon is also used by marine organisms to build shells and exoskeletons (calcium carbonate, CaCO₃). These eventually become part of ocean sediments.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Lithosphere (Earth's Crust):</strong> Carbon is stored in rocks (e.g., limestone → CaCO₃), fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas), and soil organic matter.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Input:</strong> Formation of sedimentary rocks over long periods. Accumulation of dead organic matter.</li>
          <li><strong>Output:</strong> Weathering of rocks releases carbon slowly. Burning of fossil fuels releases large amounts of CO₂ rapidly. Volcanic eruptions release CO₂ from the Earth's interior.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Human Impact:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) releases large amounts of previously stored carbon into the atmosphere as CO₂, significantly increasing its concentration.</li>
      <li>Deforestation reduces the amount of CO₂ absorbed by plants through photosynthesis.</li>
      <li>These human activities are leading to an enhanced greenhouse effect and global warming.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Terms to Remember:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Photosynthesis</li>
      <li>Respiration</li>
      <li>Decomposition</li>
      <li>Fossil fuels</li>
      <li>Greenhouse effect</li>
      <li>Carbon dioxide (CO₂)</li>
      <li>Carbon reservoirs</li>
    </ul>
