    <h2>Definition & Overview</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Definition:</strong> The gradual and orderly process of change in an ecosystem over time. It involves the replacement of one community of organisms by another, more complex community.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Process:</strong> Ecosystems are not static; they are constantly changing in response to various factors.</li>
        <li><strong>Climax Community:</strong> The final, stable, and self-sustaining community that develops at the end of succession. It's in equilibrium with the environment and resists further major change.</li>

    <h2>Types of Ecological Succession</h2>
    
    <h3>Primary Succession:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Starts from scratch:</strong> Occurs in an area <strong>devoid of life and soil</strong>, where new land is exposed or created.</li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Newly formed volcanic islands (lava flows cool and solidify).</li>
                    <li>Recently exposed rock after a glacier retreats.</li>
                    <li>New sand dunes.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Pioneer Species:</strong> The first organisms to colonize these barren environments.
                <ul>
                    <li>Characteristics: Hardy, able to tolerate harsh conditions (lack of soil, nutrients, extreme temperatures).</li>
                    <li>Examples: <em>Lichens, mosses</em> (often colonize bare rock, breaking it down to form initial soil).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Process:</strong> Pioneer species colonize, begin to break down rock (physical and chemical weathering), add organic matter when they die, forming rudimentary soil. This makes the environment more hospitable for subsequent species.</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Secondary Succession:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Starts with existing soil:</strong> Occurs in an area where an <strong>existing community has been disturbed or removed, but the soil remains intact.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Abandoned agricultural fields.</li>
                        <li>Areas after a forest fire.</li>
                        <li>Areas after a clear-cutting operation.</li>
                        <li>Areas after a flood or hurricane.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Faster than Primary Succession:</strong> Because soil and some seeds/spores are already present, the process is much quicker.</li>
                <li><strong>Pioneer Species (in this context):</strong> Often grasses, weeds, and fast-growing annual plants that quickly colonize the disturbed area.</li>
                <img src="image3.png">
            </ul>
        </li>

        <h2>Stages of Succession (General)</h2>
        <p>While the specific species change, the pattern is similar:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Pioneer Stage:</strong> Initial colonization by hardy species.</li>
            <li><strong>Intermediate Stages (Seral Stages / Seral Communities):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>A series of temporary communities that gradually replace each other.</li>
                    <li>Each stage modifies the environment, making it more suitable for the next stage's species.</li>
                    <li>Increasing biodiversity, biomass, and complexity of food webs.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Climax Community:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The relatively stable, mature community.</li>
                    <li>High biodiversity and complex food webs.</li>
                    <li>Biomass and productivity are relatively stable.</li>
                    <li>Resistant to minor disturbances.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Key Concepts & Terms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pioneer Species:</strong> First colonizers.</li>
            <li><strong>Seral Stage/Community:</strong> Each transitional community in the successional sequence.</li>
            <li><strong>Climax Community:</strong> Stable, mature end-stage.</li>
            <li><strong>Facilitation:</strong> Early species modify the environment in ways that make it more suitable
                for later species. (e.g., lichens create soil for mosses).</li>
            <li><strong>Inhibition:</strong> Some species hinder the establishment or growth of others.</li>
            <li><strong>Tolerance:</strong> Later species are tolerant of conditions created by earlier species, or are
                simply not affected by them.</li>
            <li><strong>Disturbance:</strong> Events that disrupt an ecosystem (e.g., fire, flood, human activity),
                often initiating secondary succession.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Factors Influencing Succession</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Temperature, rainfall determine the type of climax community (e.g., forest,
                grassland, desert).</li>
            <li><strong>Topography:</strong> Slope, aspect (direction it faces).</li>
            <li><strong>Soil</strong></li>
    </ul>
