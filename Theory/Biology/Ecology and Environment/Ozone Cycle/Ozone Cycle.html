    <h2>Ozone Cycle</h2>
    <p>A natural process in the Earth's stratosphere (upper atmosphere) involving the continuous formation and destruction of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). Crucial for life on Earth as the ozone layer absorbs most of the harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun.</p>

    <h2>Key Processes:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Formation of Atomic Oxygen:</strong> High-energy UV radiation from the sun breaks apart oxygen molecules (O<sub>2</sub>) into two individual oxygen atoms (O): O<sub>2</sub> + UV → O + O</li>
      <li><strong>Formation of Ozone:</strong> These highly reactive single oxygen atoms then collide with other oxygen molecules (O<sub>2</sub>) to form ozone (O<sub>3</sub>): O + O<sub>2</sub> + M → O<sub>3</sub> + M (where 'M' is a third molecule like nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) or oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) that absorbs excess energy, stabilizing the ozone molecule).</li>
      <li><strong>Destruction of Ozone (Natural):</strong> Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) is unstable and naturally breaks down in two main ways:
        <ul>
          <li>Absorption of UV radiation: O<sub>3</sub> + UV → O<sub>2</sub> + O</li>
          <li>Reaction with atomic oxygen: O<sub>3</sub> + O → 2O<sub>2</sub></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>The Ozone Layer:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A region in the stratosphere (approximately 10 to 50 km above the Earth's surface) where the concentration of ozone is relatively high.</li>
      <li>This layer acts as a shield, absorbing most of the harmful UV-B and UV-C radiation from the sun, preventing it from reaching the Earth's surface.</li>
      <li>UV-B radiation can cause skin cancer, cataracts, and damage to plants and marine life. UV-C is even more harmful but is almost completely absorbed by the ozone layer and the atmosphere.</li>
      <li>As a result of the ozone cycle, energy from UV rays is dissipated as heat.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ozone Depletion (Human Impact):</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Certain human-made chemicals, particularly chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons, and other ozone-depleting substances (ODS), can catalyze the destruction of ozone in the stratosphere.</li>
      <li>These stable chemicals rise into the stratosphere, where they are broken down by UV radiation, releasing chlorine or bromine atoms.</li>
      <li>These halogen atoms act as catalysts in a chain reaction, where a single chlorine atom can destroy thousands of ozone molecules:
        <ul>
          <li>Cl + O<sub>3</sub> → ClO + O<sub>2</sub></li>
          <li>ClO + O → Cl + O<sub>2</sub> (The chlorine atom is regenerated and can destroy more ozone)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>This catalytic destruction leads to a thinning of the ozone layer, commonly referred to as the "ozone hole" (most prominent over the Antarctic).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Consequences of Ozone Depletion:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Increased levels of harmful UV-B radiation reaching the Earth's surface.</li>
      <li>Increased risk of skin cancer and cataracts in humans.</li>
      <li>Damage to the immune system.</li>
      <li>Harm to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, including reduced plant growth and damage to phytoplankton.</li>
      <li>Impacts on air quality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>International Efforts:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The Montreal Protocol is an international treaty designed to phase out the production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances. It has been largely successful in reducing the rate of ozone depletion.</li>
    </ul>
