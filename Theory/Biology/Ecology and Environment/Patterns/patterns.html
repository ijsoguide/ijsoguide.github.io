    <p>While natural selection always favors individuals with higher fitness, how it <b>changes</b> the population's traits depends on which phenotypes are being selected for or against. This leads to distinct patterns observable in trait distributions, often represented by a bell curve.</p>

    <h2>Stabilizing Selection</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Concept:</b> This pattern favors <b>intermediate phenotypes</b> (the "average" or "middle" trait value) and selects against the extreme variations at both ends of the spectrum.</li>
        <li><b>Effect on Population:</b> It reduces variation within the population, making the bell curve narrower and taller around the mean. The average trait value tends to remain stable over time.</li>
        <li><b>Conditions:</b> Occurs in <b>stable</b> environments where extreme traits are disadvantageous.</li>
        <li><b>Why it happens:</b> Individuals at the extremes may face higher mortality or reduced reproductive success.</li>
        <li>Heterozygote advantage can lead to stabilizing selection.</li>
        <li>Example: Human Birth Weight
            <ul>
                <li>Observation: Babies born with a moderate weight (e.g., 2.5-4.5 kg) have higher survival rates than very small or very large babies.</li>
                <li>Selection Pressure:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Very low birth weight: Babies are often premature, have underdeveloped organs, and struggle with heat regulation and disease resistance, leading to higher mortality.</li>
                        <li>Very high birth weight: Can lead to complications during childbirth for both mother and baby (e.g., difficult delivery), increasing mortality risk.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Result: Over generations, the genes for moderate birth weight are favored, and the population mean for birth weight remains relatively stable.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Directional Selection</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Concept:</b> This pattern favors <b>one extreme phenotype</b> over the average or the opposite extreme.</li>
        <li><b>Effect on Population:</b> It shifts the entire bell curve in one direction (towards the favored extreme). The average trait value changes over time.</li>
        <li><b>Conditions:</b> Occurs when the environment changes, or when a population migrates to a new environment, making a previously less common trait more advantageous.</li>
        <li><b>Why it happens:</b> The environment selects for individuals possessing a trait at one end of the spectrum, giving them a survival and reproductive advantage.</li>
        <li>Example: Antibiotic Resistance in Bacteria
            <ul>
                <li><b>Observation:</b> When an antibiotic is introduced to a bacterial population, most bacteria die, but a few individuals might have a <b>PRE-EXISTING</b> mutation that gives them resistance to the antibiotic. (remember that evolution and natural selection does NOT create new alleles, it just selects for the pre-existing advantageous ones)</li>
                <li><b>Selection Pressure:</b> The antibiotic acts as a strong selective pressure, killing non-resistant bacteria.</li>
                <li><b>Result:</b> The resistant bacteria survive and reproduce rapidly, passing on their resistance genes. Over time, the entire bacterial population shifts towards being predominantly antibiotic-resistant. This is why it's crucial to finish antibiotic courses, to minimize the chances for resistant strains to proliferate.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Disruptive Selection (or Diversifying Selection)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Concept:</b> This pattern favors <b>both extreme phenotypes</b> at the expense of the intermediate forms.</li>
        <li><b>Effect on Population:</b> It causes the single-peaked bell curve to split into two distinct peaks, representing two different favored phenotypes. It increases variation within the population.</li>
        <li><b>Conditions:</b> Occurs in heterogeneous environments where different niches or resources favor different extreme traits, and the intermediate trait is disadvantageous in all available niches.</li>
        <li><b>Why it happens:</b> Individuals with intermediate traits are less "fit" and have lower survival/reproductive rates than those at either extreme.</li>
        <li>Example: African Seedcracker Finches
            <ul>
                <li><b>Observation:</b> These finches feed on seeds. In their habitat, there are two main types of seeds available: very large, tough seeds and very small, soft seeds.</li>
                <li><b>Selection Pressure:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Finches with <b>large beaks</b> are very efficient at cracking the large, tough seeds.</li>
                        <li>Finches with <b>small beaks</b> are very efficient at handling the small, soft seeds.</li>
                        <li>Finches with <b>medium-sized beaks</b> are not efficient at cracking large seeds (beak too small) nor are they good at handling small seeds (beak too clumsy/large). They struggle to get enough food.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Result:</b> Over time, individuals with medium beaks are selected against, leading to a population dominated by finches with either large beaks or small beaks. This can eventually lead to the formation of two distinct sub-populations or even new species (speciation).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
