    <p><strong>Symbiosis</strong> is a close and long-term interaction between two or more different biological species. These relationships can be crucial for the survival and evolution of the involved organisms and play a significant role in ecosystem dynamics.</p>

    <h2>Types of Symbiotic Relationships:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mutualism (+/+):</strong> A relationship where both interacting species benefit.
        <ul>
          <li>Example: The relationship between bees and flowering plants. Bees obtain nectar (food), and in the process, they transfer pollen, which helps the plants reproduce.</li>
          <li>Example: Mycorrhizae are mutualistic associations between fungi and plant roots. The fungi enhance nutrient and water uptake by the plant, while the plant provides the fungi with carbohydrates.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <br>

      <li><strong>Commensalism (+/0):</strong> A relationship where one species benefits, and the other is neither harmed nor helped.
        <ul>
          <li>Example: Epiphytes (like orchids) growing on trees. The orchid benefits by getting better access to sunlight, while the tree is generally unaffected.</li>
          <li>Example: Barnacles attaching to whales. The barnacles gain a mode of transportation and access to food in different locations, while the whale is usually not harmed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <br>
      

      <li><strong>Parasitism (+/-):</strong> A relationship where one species (the parasite) benefits at the expense of the other species (the host), which is harmed. Parasites often live on or inside their hosts.
        <ul>
          <li>Example: Tapeworms living in the intestines of animals, absorbing nutrients from the host.</li>
          <li>Example: Ticks feeding on the blood of mammals.</li>
          <li>Note: Parasites usually do not kill their hosts immediately, as their survival depends on the host's survival, at least for a period.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <br>

      <li><strong>Amensalism (0/-):</strong> A relationship where one species is negatively affected by another, while the other is unaffected.
        <ul>
          <li>Example: The release of antibiotics by some microorganisms that inhibit the growth of other microorganisms.</li>
          <li>Example: A large tree shading smaller plants, preventing them from getting enough sunlight.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <br>

      <li><strong>Neutralism (0/0):</strong> A relationship where neither species affects the other. This is difficult to prove in nature, as there might be indirect or unnoticed interactions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Aspects of Symbiosis:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Obligate Symbiosis:</strong> The symbiotic relationship is essential for the survival of one or both partners. They cannot survive independently.
        <ul>
          <li>Example: Lichens, which are a composite organism formed from a fungus and an alga or cyanobacterium. The fungus provides structure and protection, while the alga/cyanobacterium provides food through photosynthesis.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <br>

      <li><strong>Facultative Symbiosis:</strong> The symbiotic relationship is beneficial but not essential for the survival of the partners. They can survive independently.
        <ul>
          <li>Example: Cleaner fish that remove parasites from larger fish. Both benefit, but they can survive without each other.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <br>

      <li><strong>Ectosymbiosis:</strong> One symbiont lives on the surface of the other.
        <ul>
          <li>Example: Lice on a human head.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <br>

      <li><strong>Endosymbiosis:</strong> One symbiont lives inside the tissues of the other.
        <ul>
          <li>Example: Nitrogen-fixing bacteria (Rhizobium) living in the root nodules of leguminous plants.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
