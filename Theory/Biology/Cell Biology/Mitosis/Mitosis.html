    <p>
        Cell division is a fundamental process in all living organisms, allowing for growth, repair, and reproduction. The two main types of cell division are <strong>Mitosis</strong> and <strong>Meiosis</strong>, each with distinct purposes and outcomes. Understanding the precise behavior of chromosomes during these processes is key to grasping their biological significance.

    <h2>Mitosis: For Growth and Repair</h2>
    <p>
        Mitosis is a type of cell division that results in two daughter cells, each having the same number and kind of chromosomes as the parent nucleus. The chromosome number remains constant.
    </p>
    <h3>Purpose of Mitosis:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Growth:</strong> Increases the number of cells in a multicellular organism.</li>
        <li><strong>Repair and Replacement:</strong> Replaces old or damaged cells (e.g., skin cells, blood cells).</li>
        <li><strong>Asexual Reproduction:</strong> How single-celled organisms reproduce, and some multicellular organisms grow.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Key Outcomes of Mitosis:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Produces <strong>two genetically identical daughter cells</strong>.</li>
        <li>Daughter cells are <strong>diploid (2n)</strong>, meaning they have a full set of chromosomes.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Stages of Mitosis (M Phase) and Chromosome Behavior:</h3>
    <p>
        Before mitosis begins, during <strong>Interphase</strong> (G1, S, G2 phases), the cell grows, and its DNA replicates. In the S phase, each chromosome duplicates to form two identical <strong>sister chromatids</strong> joined at the <strong>centromere</strong>.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Prophase:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Chromosomes condense, becoming shorter, thicker, and visible. Each is distinctly seen as two sister chromatids.</li>
                <li>The nuclear envelope breaks down, and the nucleolus disappears.</li>
                <li>Spindle fibers begin to form from centrosomes moving to opposite poles.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
         <li><strong>Prometaphase:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The nuclear envelope completely fragments, allowing the spindle microtubules to invade the nuclear area.</li>
                <li>Each sister chromatid develops a specialized protein structure called a <strong>kinetochore</strong> at the centromere.</li>
                <li>Microtubules from the spindle poles attach to these kinetochores, pulling the chromosomes into oscillatory movements.</li>
            </ul>
        <li><strong>Metaphase:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Chromosomes are maximally condensed.</li>
                <li>They align individually along the cell's central plane, called the <strong>metaphase plate</strong>.</li>
                <li>Crucially, the kinetochore of <strong>each</strong> sister chromatid attaches to spindle microtubules from <strong>opposite</strong> poles. This arrangement ensures even distribution.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Anaphase:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The cohesin proteins holding sister chromatids together at the centromere suddenly break down.</li>
                <li>Sister chromatids separate, becoming independent chromosomes, and are pulled by shortening spindle fibers towards opposite poles of the cell. The centromere leads the way.</li>
                <li>The cell elongates.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Telophase:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Individual chromosomes arrive at opposite poles and begin to decondense.</li>
                <li>New nuclear envelopes form around each set of chromosomes, forming two nuclei.</li>
                <li>Spindle fibers disappear.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cytokinesis:</strong> The cytoplasm divides, typically creating two separate daughter cells, each with a complete and identical diploid set of single chromosomes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Meiosis: For Sexual Reproduction and Variation</h2>
    <p>
        Meiosis is a specialized type of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half, creating four haploid cells. It is essential for sexual reproduction and introduces genetic diversity.
    </p>
    <h3>Purpose of Meiosis:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gamete Formation:</strong> Produces sex cells (sperm/eggs) with half the number of chromosomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Genetic Variation:</strong> Introduces diversity through crossing over and independent assortment.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Key Outcomes of Meiosis:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Produces <strong>four genetically unique daughter cells</strong>.</li>
        <li>Daughter cells are <strong>haploid (n)</strong>, meaning they have half the number of chromosomes of the parent cell.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Stages of Meiosis (Two Divisions) and Chromosome Behavior:</h3>
    <p>
        Meiosis involves one round of DNA replication (in Interphase I) followed by two rounds of nuclear division (Meiosis I and Meiosis II).
    </p>
    <h4>Meiosis I (Reductional Division):</h4>
    <p>This division separates homologous chromosomes and reduces the chromosome number from diploid to haploid.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Interphase I:</strong> Cell grows, and DNA replicates in the S phase, so each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids.</li>
        <li><strong>Prophase I:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Chromosomes condense.</li>
                <li><strong>Synapsis:</strong> Homologous chromosomes (one from each parent) pair up precisely along their length, forming <strong>bivalents</strong> (or tetrads, due to four chromatids). This pairing is unique to meiosis.</li>
                <li><strong>Crossing Over:</strong> Genetic material is exchanged between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes at points called <strong>chiasmata</strong>. This creates recombinant chromosomes, increasing genetic variation.</li>
                <li>Nuclear envelope breaks down.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="image2.png">
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Metaphase I:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Homologous pairs (bivalents/tetrads), NOT individual chromosomes, align along the metaphase plate.</li>
                <li><strong>Independent Assortment:</strong> The orientation of each homologous pair is random, contributing further to genetic diversity in the resulting gametes. Each homologous chromosome is attached to spindle fibers from one pole.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Anaphase I:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Homologous chromosomes separate and move towards opposite poles.</li>
                <li>Crucially, <strong>sister chromatids remain attached</strong> at their centromeres and move as a single unit to the same pole. This is a major distinction from mitosis.</li>
                <li>The chromosome number at each pole is now haploid (n), but each chromosome is still duplicated (two chromatids).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Telophase I &amp; Cytokinesis:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Chromosomes arrive at poles (haploid number, but duplicated).</li>
                <li>New nuclear envelopes may form. Cytokinesis divides the cell, resulting in two haploid cells.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Meiosis II (Equational Division):</h4>
    <p>This division separates sister chromatids, similar to mitosis but occurring in two haploid cells.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Interkinesis:</strong> A brief resting period may occur between Meiosis I and II, but no DNA replication takes place.</li>
        <li><strong>Prophase II:</strong> Chromosomes condense again (if decondensed). New spindles form in each of the two haploid cells.</li>
        <li><strong>Metaphase II:</strong> Chromosomes (each with two sister chromatids) align individually along the metaphase plate of each cell. Sister chromatids are attached to spindle fibers from opposite poles.</li>
        <li><strong>Anaphase II:</strong> Sister chromatids separate at their centromeres and are pulled to opposite poles as individual chromosomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Telophase II &amp; Cytokinesis:</strong> Chromosomes arrive at poles and decondense. New nuclear envelopes form. Cytokinesis divides each cell, resulting in a total of <strong>four genetically unique haploid daughter cells</strong>, each containing single (un-duplicated) chromosomes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Differences in Chromosome Behavior</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>DNA Replication:</strong> Once before Mitosis; Once before Meiosis I (none before Meiosis II).</li>
        <li><strong>Homologous Pairing:</strong> Occurs only in Prophase I of Meiosis (forming bivalents/tetrads). Absent in Mitosis.</li>
        <li><strong>Crossing Over:</strong> Occurs only in Prophase I of Meiosis, creating genetic recombination. Absent in Mitosis.</li>
        <li><strong>Metaphase Alignment:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Mitosis & Meiosis II: Individual duplicated chromosomes align.</li>
                <li>Meiosis I: Homologous pairs align.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Anaphase Separation:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Mitosis & Meiosis II: Sister chromatids separate.</li>
                <li>Meiosis I: Homologous chromosomes separate (sister chromatids remain attached).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Outcome:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Mitosis: 2 genetically identical diploid cells.</li>
                <li>Meiosis: 4 genetically unique haploid cells.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
