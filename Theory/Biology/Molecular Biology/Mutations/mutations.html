    <h3>What Are Mutations?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence that can affect how genes function.</li>
        <li>Mutations can occur naturally or be caused by environmental factors like UV radiation or chemicals.</li>
        <li>Mutations may result in a change in protein structure, which can affect traits or lead to diseases.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Types of Mutations</h3>
    <p>Mutations can be classified into two main types based on their impact on the codons:</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Point Mutations
            <ul>
                <li>Definition: A change in one single nucleotide of the DNA sequence.</li>
                <li>Subtypes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Substitution: One nucleotide is replaced with another.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Example: A ‚Üí G (Adenine is replaced by Guanine).</li>
                                <li>Effect: Can lead to:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Silent mutation (no change to the protein).</li>
                                        <li>Missense mutation (a different amino acid is produced).</li>
                                        <li>Nonsense mutation (introduces a stop codon, shortening the protein).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Insertion: One or more nucleotides are added to the DNA sequence.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Example: A new nucleotide is added between two existing bases.</li>
                                <li>Effect: Insertion can sometimes lead to a frameshift, but if the change is small, it can still be considered a point mutation.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Deletion: One or more nucleotides are removed from the DNA sequence.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Example: One nucleotide is removed from the sequence.</li>
                                <li>Effect: Deletion can also cause a frameshift, but if it‚Äôs small, it‚Äôs considered a point mutation.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Frameshift Mutations
            <ul>
                <li>Definition: A mutation where insertions or deletions cause a shift in the reading frame of the codons.</li>
                <li>Effect: This shifts the entire codon sequence, altering the protein from the point of mutation onward.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Insertion: Adding a base shifts the reading frame.</li>
                        <li>Deletion: Removing a base shifts the reading frame.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Impact: Frameshift mutations almost always lead to severe changes in the protein‚Äôs structure and function.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Types of Mutations Based on Their Effect on the Protein:</h3>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Silent Mutation:
            <ul>
                <li>Definition: A mutation that does not affect the protein because the new codon still codes for the same amino acid.</li>
                <li>Example: A change in DNA that results in the same amino acid being added to the protein.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Missense Mutation:
            <ul>
                <li>Definition: A mutation that results in a different amino acid being incorporated into the protein.</li>
                <li>Effect:
                    The protein may function differently, or in some cases, may be nonfunctional.</li>
                <li>Example:
                    Sickle cell disease is caused by a missense mutation in the hemoglobin gene.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Nonsense Mutation:
            <ul>
                <li>Definition: A mutation that causes an early stop codon, leading to a truncated (shortened) protein.</li>
                <li>Effect:
                    The protein is often nonfunctional or incomplete.</li>
                <li>Example: A mutation in a gene that causes cystic fibrosis can be caused by a nonsense mutation.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Mutation in the Context of Evolution</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Mutations are a key source of genetic variation in populations.</li>
        <li>Beneficial mutations can be selected for over generations, leading to evolution.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>üéØ Pro Tip</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Point Mutations = Small changes in the DNA sequence (Substitution, Insertion, Deletion).</li>
        <li>Frameshift Mutations = Larger changes that shift the codon reading frame (Insertions and Deletions).</li>
        <li>Silent, Missense, and Nonsense = Based on how the mutation impacts the protein structure.</li>
    </ul>
