    <h2>Enzyme Activity</h2>

 <p>Enzymes are highly specific <b>biological catalysts</b>, mostly proteins, that accelerate biochemical reactions without being consumed in the process.</p>

    <h2>Fundamental Principles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Catalysis:</b> Enzymes speed up reactions by lowering the <b>activation energy</b> (E<sub>a</sub>), the minimum energy required for a reaction to occur. They do not change the overall energy difference between reactants and products.</li>
        <img src="image1.png">
        <li><b>Active Site:</b> A specific 3D region on the enzyme molecule where the reactant, called the <b>substrate</b>, binds. The active site's shape and chemical properties are complementary to its specific substrate.</li>
        <img src="image2.png">
        <li><b>Specificity:</b> Enzymes are highly specific; each enzyme typically catalyzes only one or a very limited number of reactions.</li>
        <li><b>Induced-Fit Model:</b> The active site is not rigid. When the substrate binds, the enzyme undergoes a slight conformational change, molding more tightly around the substrate. This induced fit stresses bonds in the substrate, facilitating the reaction.</li>
        <li><b>Reusability:</b> After products are released, the enzyme returns to its original state and can catalyze the reaction again.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity</h2>
    <p>Enzyme activity is sensitive to environmental conditions, which can influence the enzyme's three-dimensional structure and thus its ability to bind substrates and catalyze reactions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Temperature:</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Low Temperatures:</b> Enzyme activity decreases, but the enzyme is usually not denatured. Reactions slow down due to less kinetic energy.</li>
                <li><b>Optimum Temperature:</b> The temperature at which an enzyme exhibits maximum activity.</li>
                <li><b>High Temperatures:</b> Enzyme activity increases initially with rising temperature (due to increased kinetic energy), but beyond the optimum, the enzyme's structure begins to break down, leading to <b>denaturation</b>.</li>
                <img src="image3.png">
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>pH:</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Optimum pH:</b> The specific pH value at which an enzyme is most active. This varies greatly for different enzymes (e.g., pepsin in stomach acid has a low optimum pH, while trypsin in the small intestine has a higher optimum pH).</li>
                <li><b>Extreme pH:</b> Deviations from the optimum pH (too acidic or too alkaline) can alter the enzyme's ionic state, disrupt its active site conformation, and lead to <b>denaturation</b>.</li>
                <img src="image4.png">
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Substrate Concentration:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>As substrate concentration increases, the reaction rate generally increases because more active sites are occupied.</li>
                <li>At very high substrate concentrations, the enzyme becomes <b>saturated</b>, meaning all active sites are continuously occupied. At this point, increasing substrate concentration further will not significantly increase the reaction rate; the reaction rate reaches its maximum (V<sub>max</sub>).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Enzyme Concentration:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Assuming sufficient substrate is available, increasing the enzyme concentration directly increases the reaction rate. More enzyme molecules mean more available active sites to process the substrate.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Denaturation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Definition:</b> The irreversible loss of an enzyme's specific three-dimensional structure (especially its active site) due to extreme conditions (e.g., very high temperatures, extreme pH).</li>
        <li><b>Effect:</b> A denatured enzyme loses its catalytic activity because its active site can no longer bind the substrate effectively.</li>
    </ul>
