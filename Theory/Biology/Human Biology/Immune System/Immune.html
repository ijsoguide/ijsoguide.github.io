    <p>The immune system is a complex system of organs, cells and proteins that primarily defends the body against infections.</p>

    <h3>Major <strong>organs</strong> of the Immune System:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bone marrow</strong><br>The bone marrow is a soft jello-like tissue found inside the bones.<br>The cells of the immune system are created in the bone marrow from stem cells.</li>
      <li><strong>Thymus</strong><br>The thymus is a major gland located in the middle of the chest between the lungs.
        <ul>
          <li>A certain type of white blood cells (T Lymphocytes) mature in the thymus.</li>
          <li>It is resposnible for keeping the immune system working properly.</li>
          <li>It prevents human autoimmune diseases through induction of apoptosis to autoreactive T cells. Any disturbance in this process can lead to the escape of autoreactive T cells that may trigger an autoimmune disease.</li>
          <li>It’s constantly growing in size and reaches its peak during childhood. After puberty is gradually shrinks and becomes less active.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Lymph nodes</strong><br>Lymph nodes are tissues full of immune cells. They are located strategically everywhere throughout the body. Some are in the neck, the armpit, the genital region, digestive tract etc.<br>They are connected with each other through a large network of blood and lymphatic vessels.</li>
      <li><strong>Spleen</strong><br>It contains a large number of immune system cells.
        <ul>
          <li>About 25 percent of the blood that comes from the heart flows through the spleen on every beat</li>
          <li>As blood circulates through the spleen, it is filtered to detect pathogens.</li>
          <li>If pathogens are detected, immune system cells are activated and increase in number.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Skin</strong><br>Skin serves as an important physical barrier from many of the disease-causing agents that we come into contact with on a daily basis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The immune system is divided into two lines of defence:</h3>
    <p>The <strong><em>Innate</em></strong> Immune System<br>The <strong><em>Adaptive</em></strong> Immune System</p>
    <p>The first line of defence. When a pathogens enters the body, certain cells can quickly respond.<br>The second line of defence. Certain cells create special proteins to destroy a specific pathogen. It is more effective and can create long lasting immunity.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Physical barriers</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>The skin is an important protective barrier.</li>
            <li>Openings into our bodies like nose, mouth, respiratory, digestive, and genital tracts have additional protective features:
              <ul>
                <li>Mucus coating</li>
                <li>Cilia and nasal hairs</li>
                <li>Responses like sneezing, watery eyes, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Chemical barriers</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Mucus contains lysozymes</li>
            <li>Stomach acid (HCl)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>The white blood cells (leukocytes) are divided into:</h4>

      <strong>Granulocytes:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Neutrophils:</strong> Most common, phagocytic, fight bacteria.</li>
        <li><strong>Eosinophils:</strong> Target parasites, allergies. Release MBP, ECP, EPX, EDN.</li>
        <li><strong>Basophils:</strong> Release histamine and heparin.</li>
        <li><strong>Mast cells:</strong> Similar to basophils but live in tissues.</li>
      </ul>

      <strong>Agranulocytes:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lymphocytes:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Natural Killer Cells</em>: Kill viruses and cancer cells.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Monocytes:</strong> Become macrophages (clear debris) and dendritic cells (activate B & T cells).</li>
      </ul>

      <strong>Complement System:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Proteins from liver that aid antibodies/phagocytes.</li>
        <li>3 pathways: Classical (antibody), MB-lectin (macrophage), Alternative (amplification loop).</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lymphocytes:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>T Cells</strong> (mature in Thymus)
              <ul>
                <li>CD4+ (Helper): Activate B cells & cytotoxic T cells</li>
                <li>CD8+ (Killer): Kill infected cells</li>
                <li>Memory T Cells: Long term immunity</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>B Cells</strong> (mature in Bone marrow)
              <ul>
                <li>Become Plasma Cells: Make antibodies</li>
                <li>Memory B Cells: For long term immunity</li>
