  <h2>Overview & Purpose</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Respiration:</strong> The overall process involving gas exchange between an organism and its environment, and cellular respiration within cells.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Primary Function:</strong> To supply body tissues with oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) needed for cellular respiration and to remove the waste product, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>).
    </li>
    <li><strong>Equation:</strong> C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub> → 6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O + ATP</li>
    <li><strong>Processes:</strong>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Pulmonary Ventilation: </strong>Breathing (moving air in and out of lungs).
        </li>
        <li><strong>External Respiration: </strong>Gas exchange between alveoli (lungs) and blood.</li>
        <li><strong>Transport of Gases: </strong>Movement of O<sub>2</sub>​ and CO<sub>2</sub>​ in the blood.</li>
        <li><strong>Internal Respiration: </strong>Gas exchange between blood and body tissues/cells.</li>
      </ol>

  <!--Respiratory Tract-->
  <h2>The Respiratory Tract</h2>
  <img src="image1.png" alt="Respiratory Tract" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; margin: auto; display: block; border-radius: 10px;" />

  <ul>
    <li style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>(a) Nasal Cavity (Mouth):</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Air enters. Hairs filter large particles.
            </li>
            <li>Lined with mucous membrane: Warms, moistens, and traps finer particles/pathogens. Rich blood supply aids warming.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>(b) Pharynx (Throat):</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Common passage for air (to larynx) and food (to esophagus).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Larynx (Voice Box):</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Connects pharynx to trachea. Made of cartilage.
            </li>
            <li>Contains <strong>vocal cords</strong> for sound production.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Epiglottis</strong> covers larynx opening during swallowing to prevent food entry.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Trachea (Windpipe):</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Tube located anterior to the esophagus.
            </li>
            <li>Supported by C-shaped rings of <strong>cartilage</strong> which prevent collapse.
            </li>
            <li>Lined with <strong>ciliated epithelium</strong> and goblet cells (produce mucus). The <strong>mucociliary escalator</strong> traps debris and moves it up towards the pharynx to be swallowed or expelled.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Bronchi & Bronchioles:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Trachea divides into two <strong>primary bronchi</strong> (left and right), one entering each lung. Bronchi also have cartilage rings and ciliated lining.
            </li>
            <li>Primary bronchi branch repeatedly into smaller <strong>secondary bronchi, tertiary bronchi,</strong> and finally tiny <strong>bronchioles.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>Bronchioles have less cartilage and more smooth muscle (allowing diameter regulation). They lead to the alveoli.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Alveoli:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Tiny (~0.2 mm diameter), thin-walled air sacs clustered at the ends of bronchioles (like grapes). Approx. 300-500 million in human lungs.

            </li>
            <li><strong>Functional Unit:</strong> The site of gas exchange between lungs and blood.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Walls are extremely thin (one cell thick). Surrounded by a dense network of capillaries. Surface is moist.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <hr>
  <!--Lungs and Pleural Membranes-->

  <h2>Lungs and Pleural Membranes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Lungs:</strong> Pair of spongy, cone-shaped organs located in the <strong>thoracic cavity</strong>, protected by the rib cage. Right lung has 3 lobes, left lung has 2 lobes (leaving space for the heart).
    </li>
    <li><strong>Pleura:</strong> Each lung is enclosed by a double-layered membrane called the pleura.

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Visceral Pleura:</strong> Covers lung surface.</li>
        <li><strong>Parietal Pleura:</strong> Lines the thoracic cavity wall.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Pleural Fluid:</strong> Potential space between the layers containing <strong>pleural fluid</strong>, which lubricates and reduces friction during breathing, and helps keep lungs inflated due to surface tension.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

    <hr>
    <!--Mechanism of Breathing-->

  <h2>Mechanism of Breathing (Pulmonary Ventilation)</h2>
    <p style="margin: 3rem;">Breathing involves changes in the volume of the thoracic cavity, driven by muscle contractions, leading to air pressure changes. Air moves from higher pressure to lower pressure.
    </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Inspiration (Active)</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Diaphragm:</strong> Contracts and flattens (moves downwards).</li>
      <li><strong>External Intercostal Muscles:</strong> Contract, pulling the rib cage upwards and outwards.
    </li>
      <li><strong>Result:</strong> Volume of thoracic cavity increases → Pressure inside the lungs (intrapulmonary pressure) decreases below atmospheric pressure → Air flows into the lungs.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Expiration (Exhalation) - Passive Process (usually):
    </strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Diaphragm:</strong> Relaxes and returns to its dome shape (moves upwards).</li>
      <li><strong>External Intercostal Muscles:</strong> Relax, allowing the rib cage to move downwards and inwards due to gravity and elastic recoil.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Result:</strong> Volume of thoracic cavity decreases → Pressure inside the lungs increases above atmospheric pressure → Air flows out of the lungs.</li>
      <li><strong>Forced Expiration:</strong>  An active process involving contraction of internal intercostal muscles and abdominal muscles.</li>
    </ul>

  </ul>

  <hr>
  <!--Gas Exchange-->

  <h2>Gas Exchange  (External Respiration)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Occurs across the <strong>respiratory membrane</strong> (alveolar epithelium + capillary endothelium + fused basement membranes).
    </li>
    <li>Driven by differences in <strong>partial pressures (P)</strong> of gases. Gases diffuse independently down their pressure gradients.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Oxygen(<strong>O<sub>2</sub></strong>) Diffusion:</strong>  PO2​ is high in alveolar air (~104 mmHg) and low in pulmonary capillary blood (~40 mmHg) → O2​ diffuses from alveoli into blood.
</li>
            <li><strong>Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) Diffusion::</strong> From blood (PCO<sub>2</sub> ~45 mmHg) to alveoli (PCO<sub>2</sub> ~40 mmHg).</li>
    </li>
        </ul>

    <li><strong>Factors Ensuring Efficiency:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Large Surface Area:</strong> Combined surface area of all alveoli is huge (~70-100 m2).
</li>
        <li><strong>Thin Diffusion Barrier:</strong>  Respiratory membrane is extremely thin (~0.5 μm).</li>
        <li><strong>High Solubility/Diffusibility:</strong> (Though CO2​ is more soluble than O2​, the PO2​ gradient is steeper).
</li>
        <li><strong>Rich Blood Supply:</strong> Continuous blood flow maintains the partial pressure gradients.
</li>
        <li><strong>Moist Surface:</strong> Gases must dissolve in fluid to diffuse across membranes.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <hr> 
  <!--Transport of Gases-->

  <h2>Transport of Gases in Blood
</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Oxygen Transport:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>98.5%</strong> binds reversibly to <strong>hemoglobin (Hb)</strong> within red blood cells, forming <strong>oxyhemoglobin (HbO<sub>2</sub>​)</strong>. Hb+O<sub>2 </sub>​⇌ HbO<sub>2</sub>.
</li>
        <li><strong>~1.5%</strong>  is dissolved directly in the blood plasma.
</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Carbon Dioxide Transport:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>~70% as bicarbonate ions (HCO<sub>3</sub>−​)</strong> in the plasma. CO<sub>2</sub>​ enters RBCs, combines with water (catalyzed by <strong>carbonic anhydrase)</strong> to form carbonic acid (H<sub>2</sub>​CO<sub>3</sub>​), which dissociates into H<sup>+</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>​. The HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>​ then moves into the plasma (chloride shift maintains charge balance).</li>
        <li><!--Equation--> CO<sub>2</sub> ​+ H<sub>2</sub>​O <sup>CarbonicAnhydrase</sup> ​⇌​ H<sub>2</sub>​CO<sub>3</sub> ​⇌ H<sup>+</sup> + HC<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>​
</li>
        <li>~23% bound to hemoglobin (carbaminohemoglobin, HbCO<sub>2</sub>).</li>
        <li>~7% dissolved in blood plasma.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>

  <hr>
  <!--Regulation of Breathing-->


 
    
  <h2>Regulation of Breathing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Breathing rate and depth are controlled primarily by the <strong>respiratory center</strong> in the brainstem (medulla oblongata and pons).
    </li>
    <li>The main stimulus for breathing is the level of <strong>CO<sub>2</sub></strong>​ (and related H<sup>+</sup> concentration / pH) in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid, detected by chemoreceptors. High CO<sub>2</sub>​ increases breathing rate. O<sub>2</sub>​ levels usually play a secondary role.
    </li>

    </ul>

      <strong>Note:</strong> Carboxy anhydrase is an enzyme so it reduces the activation energy of the reaction CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O ​⇌ H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>. This means the presence of this enzyme facilitates the reaction to happen faster in both ways. In lungs, since CO<sub>2</sub> gets removed, the reaction will proceed in the backward direction to maintain equilibrium, while in the body, CO<sub>2</sub> gets added so the reaction proceeds in the forward direction until it attains equilibrium. (<em>Refer to Le Chatelier's Principle for more clarification</em>)
