    <h2>Power</h2>
    <p>Power is the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred. It tells us how quickly energy is being used or converted. The formula for power is:</p>
    <p>\[ P = \frac{W}{t} \]</p>
    <p>Where P = Power, W = Work and t = time</p>
    <p>Since work can also be expressed as force times displacement (\(W = Fd\)), power can also be written in terms of force and velocity:</p>
    <p>\[ P = Fv \]</p>

    <h2>Efficiency</h2>
    <p>Efficiency is a measure of how effectively a system converts input energy into useful output energy. No real system is 100% efficient because some energy is always lost as heat, sound, or friction. Efficiency is calculated as:</p>
    <p>\[ \text{Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Useful Output Energy or Power}}{\text{Total Input Energy or Power}} \times 100\% \]</p>
    <p>A machine with 80% efficiency means that 80% of the input energy is converted into useful work, while 20% is lost.</p>

    <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Engines and Motors: Efficiency helps engineers design better engines, reducing fuel consumption and energy waste.</li>
      <li>Power Plants: Understanding power and efficiency is critical in energy production, such as in thermal and hydroelectric plants.</li>
      <li>Sports Science: Athletes use power to measure performance, such as in sprinting or weightlifting.</li>
    </ul>

    <button class="collapsible">Example 1</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>A crane lifts a 500 kg load to a height of 10 m in 5 seconds. What is the power output of the crane?</p>
      <p>\[
        P = \frac{W}{t} \\
        W = mgh = 500 \times 9.8 \times 10 = 49000\,J \\
        P = \frac{49000}{5} = 9800\,W = 9.8\,kW
      \]</p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">Example 2</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>A machine uses 5000 J of energy to lift an object, but only 3500 J is converted into useful work. Calculate the efficiency of the machine.</p>
      <p>\[
        \text{Efficiency} = \frac{3500}{5000} \times 100\% = 70\%
      \]</p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">Example 3</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>A hydroelectric turbine receives 8000 J of energy from falling water but produces only 6000 J of electrical energy. Find the efficiency of the turbine.</p>
      <p>\[
        \text{Efficiency} = \frac{6000}{8000} \times 100\% = 75\%
      \]</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Practice Questions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>A car engine exerts a force of 2000 N to move a car at a constant speed of 30 m/s. What is the power developed by the engine?</li>
      <li>A person runs up a flight of stairs that is 4 meters high in 3 seconds. If the person has a mass of 70 kg, how much power does he use to climb the stairs?</li>
      <li>A motor has an input power of 1000 W and an output power of 750 W. What is the efficiency of the motor?</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Solutions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>\(60\,kW\)</li>
      <li>\(914.7\,W\)</li>
      <li>\(75\%\)</li>
    </ol>
