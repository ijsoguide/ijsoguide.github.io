    <p>Newton’s laws define the basics of mechanics (specifically Newtonian mechanics). In the future, you’ll learn that there are other types too. But today, we’ll stick to the big 3: Newton's laws of motion.</p>

    <details>
      <summary>Newton’s 1st Law of Motion</summary>
      <p>An object does not change its motion unless an external force is applied on it.</p>
      <p>Remember when you were a kid and played with toy trucks? It didn’t move until you pushed it — Newton says this applies to everything, not just toys!</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Newton’s 2nd Law of Motion</summary>
      <p>The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force and inversely proportional to its mass.</p>
      <p>Translation: the harder you push, the faster it moves — unless it’s super heavy.</p>
      <p><strong>Formula:</strong> \(F = ma\)</p>
      <p>Force equals mass times acceleration — this is the core of the second law.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Newton’s 3rd Law of Motion</summary>
      <p>For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</p>
      <p>If you push a wall with 100N of force, the wall pushes back with 100N. Ever shoved a sibling and got shoved back? That’s this law in action — physics style.</p>
    </details>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Newton’s laws are everywhere — from rolling balls to rockets launching. Mastering them is step one in your physics journey!</p>
