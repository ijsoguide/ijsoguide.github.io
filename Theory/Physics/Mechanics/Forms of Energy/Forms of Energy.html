    <p>You’re reading this on a device that most likely runs on electrical energy—unless you’re a time traveler from 2100 using alien power tech. 😄 Let's explore what forms of energy exist today!</p>

    <h2>Kinetic Energy</h2>
    <p>Kinetic energy is the energy of an object due to its motion.</p>
    <p>Formula: \( E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \)</p>
    <p>Note: Kinetic energy is always positive since velocity is squared.</p>

    <h2>Potential Energy</h2>
    <p>Potential energy is stored energy due to an object's position in a force field (like gravity or elasticity).</p>
    <p>Examples: Gravitational PE, Elastic PE</p>

    <h2>Mechanical Energy</h2>
    <p>Mechanical energy is the total of kinetic and potential energies:  
      \( E_m = E_k + E_p \)</p>

    <h2>Thermal Energy</h2>
    <p>Thermal energy is heat energy—often due to particle motion and collisions in matter.</p>

    <h2>Nuclear Energy</h2>
    <p>Nuclear energy is stored in the nuclei of atoms. It’s released during fusion and fission reactions.  
    Fun fact: it’s the energy released in atomic bombs.</p>

    <h2>Chemical Energy</h2>
    <p>This is the energy stored in the bonds between atoms and molecules—released during chemical reactions.</p>

    <h2>Electromagnetic Energy</h2>
    <p>Energy carried by electromagnetic waves such as light, UV, infrared, and X-rays.</p>

    <h2>Sonic Energy</h2>
    <p>Sonic energy is stored in sound waves. It depends on wave properties like amplitude and frequency.</p>

    <button class="collapsible">Reminder: Relative Nature of Potential Energy</button>
    <div class="content">
      <ul>
        <li>Potential energy is usually defined relative to a reference point (e.g., the ground).</li>
        <li>A ball 1 m above the Earth has gravitational PE relative to the ground.</li>
        <li>Always pay attention to what point the PE is measured from!</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Final Thought</h2>
    <p>Most objects store multiple forms of energy at the same time. Understanding them helps us understand how the universe functions, from bouncing balls to nuclear stars.</p>
