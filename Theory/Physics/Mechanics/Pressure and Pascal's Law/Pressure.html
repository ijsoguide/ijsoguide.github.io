    <h2>What is Pressure?</h2>
    <p>Pressure is the force acting per unit area on a surface.</p>
    <p>\[
    P = \frac{F}{A}
    \]</p>
    <p>Where \( P \) is pressure, \( F \) is force, and \( A \) is area. Pressure is measured in pascals (Pa). \( 1 \, \text{Pa} = 1 \, \text{N/m}^2 \)</p>

    <h2>Pressure in a Liquid Column</h2>
    <p>In a fluid, pressure increases with depth. The pressure at depth \( h \) is given by:</p>
    <p>\[
    P = h\rho g
    \]</p>
    <p>Where \( h \) is the depth, \( \rho \) is the fluid density, and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity.</p>

    <h2>Pascal’s Law</h2>
    <p>Pascal’s law states that a change in pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished to all parts of the fluid and to the walls of its container.</p>

    <p>This principle is the basis for hydraulic systems, which use an incompressible fluid to transmit force.</p>

    <h2>Hydraulic Systems</h2>
    <p>If a small force is applied to a small piston, it can be used to create a larger force on a larger piston.</p>
    <p>\[
    \frac{F_1}{A_1} = \frac{F_2}{A_2}
    \]</p>
    <p>Where \( F_1 \) and \( A_1 \) are the force and area on the small piston, and \( F_2 \), \( A_2 \) on the larger piston.</p>
<br>
<p>In the system of communicating vessels, surface level of still liquid is the same in all vessels.</p>

    <h2>Practice Problems</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>A force of 200 N is applied to a surface of area 0.5 m². Find the pressure.</li>
      <li>Calculate the pressure at a depth of 10 m in water. (Use \( \rho = 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \), \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \))</li>
      <li>In a hydraulic lift, the area of the small piston is 0.01 m² and that of the large piston is 0.5 m². If a force of 100 N is applied to the small piston, find the force exerted by the large piston.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Solutions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>\( P = \frac{200}{0.5} = 400 \, \text{Pa} \)</li>
      <li>\( P = 10 \cdot 1000 \cdot 9.8 = 98000 \, \text{Pa} \)</li>
      <li>\( \frac{100}{0.01} = \frac{F}{0.5} \Rightarrow F = 5000 \, \text{N} \)</li>
    </ol>
