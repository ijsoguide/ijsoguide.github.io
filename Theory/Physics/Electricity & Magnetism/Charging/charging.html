    <p>Objects can acquire electric charge through different methods. Two common methods are <strong>charging by friction</strong> and <strong>charging by induction</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Charging by Friction</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Occurs when two different materials are rubbed together, causing electrons to transfer from one object to the other.</li>
      <li>The object that loses electrons becomes <strong>positively charged</strong>, while the object that gains electrons becomes <strong>negatively charged</strong>.</li>
      <li>This method is common with insulating materials, where charges remain localized.</li>
      <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Rubbing a plastic rod with wool transfers electrons to the rod, making it negatively charged.</li>
          <li>Rubbing a glass rod with silk transfers electrons away from the glass, making it positively charged.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>This process is responsible for static electricity buildup.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>Charging by Induction</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Involves charging an object without direct contact with another charged object.</li>
      <li>A charged object is brought near (but does not touch) a neutral conductor. This causes <strong>redistribution of charges</strong> within the conductor due to electrostatic forces.</li>
      <li>One side becomes negatively charged, and the other becomes positively charged.</li>
      <li>If the conductor is then grounded, charges can enter or leave, and the object becomes permanently charged after the external charged object is removed.</li>
      <li>This method works only with <strong>conductors</strong>, where charges are free to move.</li>
      <li><strong>Important:</strong> The induced charge is always <strong>opposite in sign</strong> to the charge of the nearby object.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>Key Differences</h2>

        <tr>
          <th>Property</th>
          <th>Friction</th>
          <th>Induction</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Contact required?</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
          <td>No</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Materials used</td>
          <td>Mainly insulators</td>
          <td>Conductors</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Charge origin</td>
          <td>Transferred between objects</td>
          <td>Redistributed within the object</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Type of charge</td>
          <td>Can be positive or negative depending on material</td>
          <td>Always opposite to nearby charged object</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  
    <p>Both methods are important in understanding how static electricity builds up and how charged objects can influence others without physical contact.</p>
