  <p><strong>Resistivity</strong>, denoted by \( \rho \), is a property of a material that describes how strongly it resists the flow of electric current. It is defined by the equation:</p>
  
  <p>\[
  \rho = R \cdot \frac{A}{L}
  \]</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>\( \rho \): Resistivity (Ω·m)</li>
    <li>\( R \): Resistance of the conductor (Ω)</li>
    <li>\( A \): Cross-sectional area of the conductor (m²)</li>
    <li>\( L \): Length of the conductor (m)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Resistivity is a material-specific constant — it does not depend on the size or shape of the material, but rather its nature and temperature.</p>
  
  <h2>Factors Affecting Resistivity</h2>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Material Type:</strong> Conductors (like copper and silver) have low resistivity; insulators (like rubber or glass) have high resistivity.</li>
    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> For most conductors, resistivity increases with temperature. In contrast, some semiconductors and insulators show decreased resistivity with rising temperature.</li>
    <li><strong>Impurities:</strong> Adding impurities (as in alloys) generally increases resistivity by scattering electrons more.</li>
    <li><strong>Crystal Structure and Defects:</strong> Imperfections or dislocations in the atomic lattice can also affect how easily electrons flow through the material.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Resistivity plays a critical role in designing electrical components, especially when selecting materials for wires, resistors, and electronic devices.</p>
