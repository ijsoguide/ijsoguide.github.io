    <p>Materials can be classified based on how easily they allow electric charges to move through them. This classification leads to two main types: <strong>conductors</strong> and <strong>insulators</strong>.</p>
  
    <h2>Conductors</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Conductors are materials that <strong>allow free movement of electric charges</strong>, especially electrons.</li>
      <li>In conductors, electrons are loosely bound and can move easily when an electric field is applied.</li>
      <li>They are used extensively in electrical wiring and components due to their high conductivity.</li>
      <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Copper, silver, gold, aluminum, iron, graphite, saltwater.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>Insulators</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Insulators are materials that <strong>do not allow charges to move freely</strong>.</li>
      <li>Electrons in insulators are tightly bound to their atoms and cannot move easily.</li>
      <li>They are used to protect us from electric shocks and to prevent short circuits.</li>
      <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Rubber, glass, plastic, dry wood, ceramics, pure water.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>Key Differences</h2>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Charge mobility</td>
          <td>High (charges move freely)</td>
          <td>Low (charges are bound)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Electron binding</td>

        <tr>
          <td>Electric current</td>
          <td>Easily passes through</td>
          <td>Does not pass easily</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Uses</td>
          <td>Wires, electrical components</td>
          <td>Insulation, safety coverings</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Examples</td>
          <td>Copper, silver, aluminum</td>
          <td>Rubber, plastic, glass</td>

    <h2>Semi-Conductors (Extra Knowledge)</h2>
    <p>There are also materials called <strong>semiconductors</strong> (like silicon and germanium) that have conductivity between that of conductors and insulators. Their conductivity can be modified and is used in electronics.</p>
    <br><br><br>

    <p>Understanding the difference between conductors and insulators is important in designing safe and efficient electrical systems.</p>
