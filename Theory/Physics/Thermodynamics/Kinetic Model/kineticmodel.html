    <h2>Kinetic Model of Matter</h2>

  <div class="container">
    <p>The kinetic model explains the physical properties of matter in terms of the motion of particles. It is based on the following key ideas:</p>
  
    <h2>Basic Assumptions of the Kinetic Theory</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All matter is made up of a large number of small particles (atoms or molecules).</li>
      <li>These particles are in constant random motion.</li>
      <li>There are spaces between the particles.</li>
      <li>Particles exert forces on each other (attractive or repulsive), except in ideal gases where these are negligible.</li>
      <li>Collisions between particles and with container walls are elastic (no net loss of kinetic energy).</li>
    </ul>
  
    <br>
    <h2>States of Matter</h2>
    <p>The kinetic model describes the behavior of matter in different states:</p>
  <br>
    <h3>1. Solids</h3>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Particles are closely packed in a fixed, regular arrangement.</li>
      <li>Strong intermolecular forces keep particles in place.</li>
      <li>Particles vibrate about fixed positions but do not move freely.</li>
      <li>Solids have fixed shape and volume.</li>
    </ul>
  <br>
    <h3>2. Liquids</h3>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Particles are close together but not in fixed positions.</li>
      <li>Weaker intermolecular forces than in solids allow particles to slide over one another.</li>
      <li>Liquids have a fixed volume but take the shape of their container.</li>
      <li>Particles move more freely than in solids but less than in gases.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>3. Gases</h3>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Particles are far apart and move freely at high speeds.</li>
      <li>Intermolecular forces are negligible.</li>
      <li>Gases have neither fixed shape nor fixed volume; they expand to fill the container.</li>
      <li>Particles collide frequently with each other and with container walls, exerting pressure.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <br>
    <h2>Changes of State</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>When heat is added or removed, particles gain or lose energy.</li>
      <li>Melting, boiling, and sublimation involve particles gaining energy and overcoming attractive forces.</li>
      <li>Freezing, condensation, and deposition involve particles losing energy and coming closer together.</li>
      <li>Temperature remains constant during a change of state, as energy goes into changing potential energy, not kinetic energy.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <br>
    <h2>Gas Pressure and Temperature</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Gas pressure is caused by collisions of particles with container walls.</li>
      <li>Increasing temperature increases average kinetic energy of particles.</li>
      <li>At higher temperatures, particles collide more frequently and with greater force, increasing pressure (if volume is constant).</li>
    </ul>
  
    <br>
    <h2>Brownian Motion</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Random movement of particles suspended in a fluid, observed under a microscope.</li>
      <li>Evidence for the existence of tiny, fast-moving particles (like gas molecules) that collide with larger particles (e.g., smoke or pollen grains).</li>
    </ul>
