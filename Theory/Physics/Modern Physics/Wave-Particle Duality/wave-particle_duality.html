  <p>Wave–particle duality is a fundamental concept in quantum physics which states that particles such as electrons and photons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties depending on the type of experiment being performed.</p>

  <h2>Light as a Particle</h2>
  <p>In the photoelectric effect, light behaves like a stream of particles called photons. Each photon has an energy given by:</p>
  <p>\[
  E = hf
  \]</p>
  <ul>
    <li>\(E\) = energy of the photon (Joules)</li>
    <li>\(h\) = Planck's constant (\(6.63 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{Js}\))</li>
    <li>\(f\) = frequency of light (Hz)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Light as a Wave</h2>
  <p>Light also shows wave-like behavior in interference and diffraction experiments. It has a wavelength related to its speed and frequency:</p>
  <p>\[
  c = \lambda f
  \]</p>
  <ul>
    <li>\(c\) = speed of light (\(3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\))</li>
    <li>\(\lambda\) = wavelength (m)</li>
    <li>\(f\) = frequency (Hz)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>de Broglie Hypothesis</h2>
  <p>Louis de Broglie proposed that matter (like electrons) also exhibits wave-like behavior. The wavelength of a particle is given by:</p>
  <p>\[
  \lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{h}{mv}
  \]</p>
  <ul>
    <li>\(\lambda\) = de Broglie wavelength (m)</li>
    <li>\(h\) = Planck’s constant</li>
    <li>\(p\) = momentum = \(mv\)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Experimental Evidence</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Photoelectric effect</strong> – shows particle behavior of light.</li>
    <li><strong>Electron diffraction</strong> – shows wave behavior of particles.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Wave–particle duality reveals that classical ideas of "particle" and "wave" are not sufficient to describe quantum objects. Instead, quantum particles have a dual nature that depends on how they are observed.</p>
