    <p>Waves are disturbances that transfer energy from one point to another without the net movement of matter. Waves can be mechanical (requiring a medium) or electromagnetic (able to travel through a vacuum). The study of wave properties helps us understand how waves behave, interact, and transfer energy.</p>

    <h2>Key Properties of Waves</h2>
  
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Wavelength (λ):</strong> The distance between two consecutive points in phase on a wave (e.g., crest to crest or trough to trough).</li>
      <li><strong>Amplitude (A):</strong> The maximum displacement of a particle from its rest position. It is related to the energy carried by the wave.</li>
      <li><strong>Frequency (f):</strong> The number of oscillations or cycles that occur in one second. Measured in hertz (Hz).</li>
      <li><strong>Period (T):</strong> The time taken for one complete cycle of the wave to pass a given point. \( T = \frac{1}{f} \)</li>
      <li><strong>Wave speed (v):</strong> The speed at which the wave travels through the medium. Given by \( v = f \lambda \)</li>
      <li><strong>Phase:</strong> Describes the position of a point in time on a waveform cycle. Two points are in phase if they move together and out of phase if they move oppositely.</li>
    </ul>
